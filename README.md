# FaceRec
A simple working facial recognition program.


## Installation:
    1. Install the dependencies

    2. Download the pretrained models here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx4sNrhhaBr3TDRMMUN3aGtHZzg/view?usp=sharing
    
        Then extract those files into models

    3. Run main.py

## Requirements:
    Python3 (3.5 ++ is recommended)

## Dependencies:

    opencv3

    numpy

    tensorflow


## Howto:
    `python3 main.py` to run the program
    `python3 main.py --mode "input"` to add new user. Start turning left, right, up, down after inputting the new name. Turn slowly to avoid blurred images

To achieve best accuracy, please try to mimick what I did here in this gif while inputting new subject:

### Flags:
   `--mode "input"` to add new user into the data set
    


## General Information:
Project: Facial Recogition

This is a simple minified version of a bigger project I was working on this summer.

### Info on the models I used:

Facial Recognition Architecture: Facenet Inception Resnet V1 

_Pretrained model is provided in Davidsandberg repo_

More information on the model: https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261

Face detection method: MTCNN

More info on MTCNN Face Detection: https://kpzhang93.github.io/MTCNN_face_detection_alignment/

Both of these models are run simultaneouslyx

### Framework and Libs:

Tensorflow: The infamous Google's Deep Learning Framework

OpenCV: Image processing (VideoCapture, resizing,..)


## Suggestions for Improvement:
To keep this repo as simple as possible, I will probably have this "plug-in" in a seperate repo:

Given the constrain of the facenet model's accuracy, there are many ways you can improve accuracy in real world application. One of my suggestion would be to create a tracker for each detected face on screen, then run recognition on each of them in real time. Then, decide who is in each tracker after some number of frames (3 - 10 frames, depending on how fast your machine is). Keep doing the same thing until the tracker disappears or loses track. Your result can look somewhat like this:

`{"Unknown" :3, "PersonA": 1, "PersonB": 20}` ---> This tracker is tracking PersonB

This will definitely improve your program liability, because the result will most likely be leaning toward the right subject in the picture after some number of frames, instead of just deciding right away after 1 frame like you normally would. One benefit of this approach is that the longer the person stays in front of the camera, the more accurate and confident the result is, as confidence points get incremented over time.
Also, you can do some multi-threading/processing tricks to improve performance.
